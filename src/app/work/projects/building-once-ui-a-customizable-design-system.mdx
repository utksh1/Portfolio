## Overview

A role-based Hostel Management System built to simplify student data handling, room allocations, and hostel workflows. The platform offers dedicated dashboards for Admins, Management, and Students with streamlined communication and task management.

## Key Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Separate login systems for Admins, Hostel Management, and Students, each with custom privileges and interface flows.
- **Room Allocation System**: Automated room assignment with tracking of availability, occupancy, and vacancy status.
- **Student Information Management**: Centralized records for student details, room history, and contact info with update and view capabilities.
- **Leave & Complaint Requests**: Students can raise leave applications or complaints directly from their dashboards for approval or review by hostel staff.
- **Admin Panel**: Full control for managing users, viewing reports, and handling backend tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: For developing backend logic and handling form submissions, authentications, and database operations.
- **MariaDB**: For storing structured data such as student records, room allocations, and logs.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces.
- **Vercel**: Used to deploy and host the live version of the platform with fast, reliable performance.

## Challenges and Learnings

Managing secure role-based access with different levels of permission was a key challenge. Implementing clean and logical dashboard flows while maintaining session security required careful handling of authentication and form validation. Optimizing SQL queries for student and room record lookups was another core learning, along with cross-role communication handling like approval flows.

## Outcome

The project successfully streamlined hostel operations by reducing paperwork, improving response times, and enhancing the overall transparency between students and hostel authorities. It serves as a complete digital solution to traditional hostel management processes and demonstrates strong backend-frontend integration with real-world usability.
