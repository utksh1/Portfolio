## Overview

 Automates GitHub commits with ease—schedule, format, and push changes automatically using simple scripts. Ideal for routine updates, streak maintenance, or keeping projects active without manual effort.

## Key Features

- **Automated Commit Scheduling**: Built a system that automatically stages, commits, and pushes code changes on a defined schedule, eliminating the need for manual Git operations.
- **Custom Commit Messages**: Generates clean, consistent commit messages using predefined formats or dynamic metadata, ensuring commit history stays informative and uniform.
- **Streak Maintenance Mode**: Optional mode to keep GitHub contribution streaks alive by committing harmless changes daily — perfect for productivity tracking and portfolio activity.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to work seamlessly across Windows and Unix-based systems with minimal setup, using standard shell or batch scripts.

## Technologies Used

- **Git CLI**: For all version control operations including staging, committing, and pushing changes.
- **Node.js / Bash / PowerShell**: For scripting automation logic depending on the platform.
- **GitHub Actions** *(optional)*: Can be integrated to run scheduled automations directly from the cloud.
- **Crontab / Task Scheduler**: Used to run the automation scripts on a recurring schedule.

## Challenges and Learnings

One major challenge was handling different system environments and Git configurations reliably. Creating a robust script that works regardless of user setup required conditional logic and flexible path handling. Ensuring commit validity without breaking the working directory also demanded careful file management.

## Outcome

This project successfully automates the most repetitive parts of version control, improving developer productivity and consistency. It's ideal for maintaining activity in public repositories, contributing to daily goals, or just removing friction from small but frequent commits.
